                    <p>
                        The College Dropout is the debut studio album by American rapper and producer Kanye West. It was
                        released on February 10, 2004, by Roc-A-Fella Records and Def Jam Recordings. In the years
                        leading up to release, West had received praise for his production work for rappers such as
                        Jay-Z and Talib Kweli, but faced difficulty being accepted as an artist in his own right by
                        figures in the music industry. Intent on pursuing a solo career, he signed a record deal with
                        Roc-A-Fella and recorded the album over a period of four years, beginning in 1999.

                        The production of The College Dropout was primarily handled by West and showcased his "chipmunk
                        soul" musical style, which made use of sped-up, pitch shifted vocal samples from soul and R&B
                        records, in addition to West's own drum programming, string accompaniments, and gospel choirs;
                        the album also features contributions from Jay-Z, Mos Def, Jamie Foxx, Syleena Johnson, and
                        Ludacris, among others. Diverging from the then-dominant gangster persona in hip hop, West's
                        lyrics concern themes of family, self-consciousness, materialism, religion, racism, and higher
                        education.

                        The College Dropout debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200, selling 441,000 copies in its
                        first week of sales. It was a large-scale commercial success, becoming West's best-selling album
                        in the United States, with domestic sales of over 3.4 million copies by 2014 and was certified
                        four-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2020. The album
                        was promoted with singles such as "Through the Wire", "Jesus Walks", "All Falls Down", and "Slow
                        Jamz", the latter two of which peaked within the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100.

                        A widespread critical success, The College Dropout was praised for West's production, humorous
                        and emotional raps, and the music's balance of self-examination and mainstream sensibilities.
                        The album earned the rapper several accolades, including nominations for Album of the Year and
                        Best Rap Album at the 2005 Grammy Awards, winning for the latter. It has since been named by
                        numerous publications as one of the greatest albums of all time, including Rolling Stone and
                        NME, who ranked it at 74 and 273 respectively on their 500 Greatest Albums of All Time lists,
                        and is credited for popularizing the chipmunk soul and conscious rap subgenres in the 2000s.

                        Late Registration is the second studio album by American rapper and producer Kanye West. It was
                        released on August 30, 2005, through Def Jam Recordings and Roc-A-Fella Records. West recorded
                        the album over the course of a year in sessions held at studios in Hollywood and New York City,
                        in collaboration with record producer and film score composer Jon Brion. The recording sessions
                        also featured guest contributions from Adam Levine, Jamie Foxx, Common, Brandy, Jay-Z, and Nas,
                        among others.

                        West's production for Late Registration departed from the sped-up soul samples of his debut
                        album The College Dropout (2004) in favor of a more elaborate, orchestral, and eclectic sound.
                        Drawing creative inspiration from alternative acts such as Fiona Apple and Portishead, he
                        experimented with intricate sampling methods, string orchestration under Brion, and a variety of
                        instruments not typically associated with hip hop or popular music, including celesta,
                        harpsichord, analog synthesizers, and Chinese bells. In an effort to write authentic yet
                        relatable lyrics, West explored both personal and broader sociopolitical concerns through
                        storytelling devices and a persona marked by humor, enthusiasm, and lament. He also continued to
                        examine his paradoxical relationship between Christian spiritual sense and market-capitalist
                        freedom, resulting in topical songs that critique sources of inequality such as institutional
                        racism, higher education, health care, drug trafficking, and the blood diamond trade.

                        Matching The College Dropout's commercial success, Late Registration debuted at number one on
                        the US Billboard 200 and sold 860,000 copies in its first week. It eventually reached more than
                        three million copies sold in the US and received a quadruple platinum certification from the
                        Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), as well as sales certifications in several
                        other countries. Five singles were released to help market the album, including the
                        international hits "Touch the Sky", "Heard 'Em Say", and "Gold Digger", the latter of which
                        topped the US Billboard Hot 100. Music videos for all five singles were also produced, while
                        West supported the album with a promotional concert tour, leading to the live album Late
                        Orchestration in 2006.

                        A widespread critical success, Late Registration was viewed as a vast progression from The
                        College Dropout and a pivotal release in hip hop. Reviewers praised its elegant and ambitious
                        musical direction while highlighting West's songwriting and performances for their balance of
                        pop and conscious rap sensibilities. The album appeared on numerous year-end critics polls,
                        being ranked as 2005's best album in Rolling Stone, Time, and the nationwide Pazz & Jop, while
                        earning West eight Grammy Award nominations, including for Album of the Year and a win for Best
                        Rap Album. Its success elevated West from a successful hip hop producer to an innovative and
                        culturally relevant recording artist in his own right. Among his most acclaimed works, Late
                        Registration frequently appears on professional lists of top albums, including Rolling Stone's
                        "500 Greatest Albums of All Time", on which it ranked 117th in 2020.

                        Graduation is the third studio album by American rapper and producer Kanye West, released on
                        September 11, 2007, through Def Jam Recordings and Roc-A-Fella Records. Recording sessions took
                        place between 2005 and 2007 at several studios in New York and Los Angeles. It was primarily
                        produced by West himself, with contributions from various other producers. The album also
                        features guest appearances from recording artists such as Dwele, T-Pain, Lil Wayne, Mos Def, DJ
                        Premier, and Chris Martin of Coldplay. The cover art and its interior artwork were designed by
                        Japanese contemporary artist Takashi Murakami.

                        Inspired by stadium tours, house-music and indie rock, Graduation marked a departure from the
                        ornate, soul-based sound of West's previous releases as he musically progressed to more anthemic
                        compositions. West incorporated layered synthesizers and dabbled with electronics while sampling
                        from various music genres and altering his approach to rapping. He conveys an ambivalent outlook
                        on his newfound fame and media scrutiny alongside providing inspirational messages of triumph
                        directed at listeners. The album concludes the education theme of West's first two studio
                        albums, The College Dropout (2004) and Late Registration (2005).

                        Graduation debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, selling over 957,000 copies in the
                        first week of sales. It has since sold over 5 million copies in the United States and been
                        certified quintuple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Five
                        accompanying singles were released, including the international hits "Stronger", "Good Life" and
                        "Homecoming", with the former of the three topping the US Billboard Hot 100. The album received
                        widely positive reviews from music critics, with several of them praising the production, and
                        earned West his third Grammy Award for Best Rap Album, as well as his third nomination for Album
                        of the Year. It was named as one of the best albums of 2007 by multiple publications, including
                        Rolling Stone and USA Today, while also listed among numerous decade-end lists and later named
                        to the lists of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time and NME's 500 Greatest Albums of
                        All Time.

                        The coinciding release dates between Graduation and fellow American rapper 50 Cent's Curtis
                        generated much publicity over the idea of a sales competition, resulting in record-breaking
                        sales performances by both albums. The success of the former and the outcome of its competition
                        with the latter marked the end of the dominance of gangsta rap in mainstream hip-hop. This is
                        credited with paving the way for other hip-hop artists who did not conform to gangster
                        conventions to find commercial acceptance.

                        808s & Heartbreak is the fourth studio album by American vocalist and record producer Kanye
                        West. It was released on November 24, 2008, by Def Jam Recordings and Roc-A-Fella Records. West
                        recorded the album during September and October 2008 at Glenwood Studios in Burbank, California
                        and Avex Recording Studio in Honolulu, Hawaii, with the help of producers No I.D., Jeff Bhasker,
                        and others. The sessions also featured guest appearances by vocalists such as Kid Cudi, Young
                        Jeezy, Mr Hudson, and Lil Wayne.

                        Conceived in the wake of several distressing personal events for West, 808s & Heartbreak marked
                        a major musical departure from his previous rap records, instead featuring a sparse, electronic
                        sound and vocals sung through an Auto-Tune processor. The production also abandons conventional
                        hip hop sounds in favor of a minimalist sonic palette, with prominent use of the Roland TR-808
                        drum machine. West's lyrics on the album explore themes of loss, alienated fame, and heartache,
                        inspired by the breakup with his fiancée, his struggles with pop stardom, and the death of his
                        mother.

                        808s & Heartbreak debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling just over 450,000 copies
                        in its first week. Despite varying responses from listeners, the album received positive reviews
                        from most music critics, who generally commended West's experimentation, and was named one of
                        2008's best records in several year-end lists. Four singles were released in promotion,
                        including the hit singles "Love Lockdown", which became West's highest Billboard Hot 100 debut
                        of his career, and "Heartless". Despite its positive critical reception, the album was largely
                        overlooked as a contender for the 52nd Grammy Awards, although the single "Amazing" received a
                        nomination in the category of Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group.

                        In the years since its release, 808s & Heartbreak has since been cited as a prominent influence
                        on subsequent hip hop, pop, and R&B music, pioneering emo rap and experimental R&B developments
                        in particular. This was due to a new wave of rappers, singers, and producers coming to adopt
                        aspects of its style and thematic content. Rolling Stone included 808s & Heartbreak in its list
                        of "The 40 Most Groundbreaking Albums of All Time" and ranked it number 244 on its revision to
                        the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list. By 2013, the album had sold 1.7 million copies in the
                        United States, and was certified triple platinum in the US by the Recording Industry Association
                        of America (RIAA) in 2020.

                        My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is the fifth studio album by American rapper and producer
                        Kanye West. It was released on November 22, 2010, by Def Jam Recordings and Roc-A-Fella Records
                        following a period of public controversy for West. Retreating to a self-imposed exile in Hawaii
                        in 2009, he recorded the album at Honolulu's Avex Studio in a communal environment involving
                        numerous contributing musicians. Additional recording sessions took place at Glenwood Place
                        Studios in Burbank, California, and at Electric Lady Studios and Platinum Sound Studios in New
                        York City.

                        The album was produced primarily by West, alongside a variety of high-profile producers such as
                        Mike Dean, No I.D., Jeff Bhasker, RZA, S1, Bink, and DJ Frank E. Critical commentaries note the
                        resulting music's maximalist aesthetic and opulent production style that utilizes various
                        elements from West's previous work, including soul, pop, baroque, electro, and symphonic sounds,
                        as well as progressive rock influences. Thematically, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy explores
                        West's status as a celebrity, consumer culture, race, and the idealism of the American Dream.
                        Guest vocalists on the album include Nicki Minaj, Rihanna, Bon Iver, Jay-Z, Pusha T, Rick Ross,
                        Kid Cudi, John Legend, Elton John and Raekwon.

                        To help market the album, West released free songs through his weekly GOOD Fridays series and
                        four singles – "Power", "Runaway", "Monster", and "All of the Lights" – all of which were top 40
                        hits on the Billboard Hot 100. West also released a musical short film, Runaway (2010), set to
                        music from the album. In its first week of release, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy debuted at
                        number one on the US Billboard 200 and sold 496,000 copies, eventually registering three million
                        units for a triple platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America
                        (RIAA). It has also been played at least one billion times through the music streaming service
                        Spotify.

                        My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was an immediate and widespread critical success, and was
                        named the best album of 2010 in many publications' year-end lists, including the annual Pazz &
                        Jop poll of American critics nationwide. The album also won Best Rap Album at the 2012 Grammy
                        Awards but was not nominated for Album of the Year, which was viewed as a "snub" by several
                        media outlets. The album's hit single "All of the Lights" won Best Rap Song and Best Rap/Sung
                        Collaboration. Widely considered West's best album, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy has ranked
                        in several professionally curated lists as the best album of the 2010s and among the greatest of
                        all time according to NME and Rolling Stone. George Condo's accompanying artwork – illustrating
                        West being straddled by an armless winged female (resembling a mythological figure) – has been
                        ranked among the greatest album covers.

                        Yeezus is the sixth studio album by American rapper and producer Kanye West. It was released on
                        June 18, 2013, through Def Jam Recordings and Roc-A-Fella Records. West gathered a number of
                        artists and close collaborators for the production, including Mike Dean, Daft Punk, Noah
                        Goldstein, Arca, Hudson Mohawke, and Travis Scott. The album also features guest vocals from
                        Justin Vernon, Chief Keef, Kid Cudi, Assassin, King L, Charlie Wilson, and Frank Ocean.

                        Fifteen days before its release date, West enlisted the help of producer Rick Rubin to strip
                        down the sound of Yeezus in favor of a more minimalist approach. The album has been
                        characterized as West's most experimental and sonically abrasive work. It draws from an array of
                        genres, including industrial, acid house, electro, punk, and Chicago drill. West's
                        unconventional use of samples is also contained, as on "Blood on the Leaves", which contains a
                        sample from Nina Simone's 1965 rendition of "Strange Fruit".

                        No album artwork is featured on the release of the former, and the physical CD edition was
                        released in a clear jewel box with only a strip of red tape and sample credits. Initial
                        promotion included worldwide video projections of the music and live television performances.
                        West released two singles from the album; "Black Skinhead" in July 2013 and "Bound 2" the
                        following month. The release of Yeezus coincided with that of rapper J. Cole's album Born
                        Sinner, which was moved back a week to coincide with Yeezus' release, leading to speculation
                        about which release would sell more copies.

                        Yeezus received widespread acclaim from critics, many of whom named it among West's best work
                        and commended its brash direction, though public response was divided. The album was nominated
                        for Best Rap Album at the 2014 Grammy Awards. The album debuted at number one on the US
                        Billboard 200, selling 327,000 copies in the first week of release, while also topping the
                        charts in Australia, Canada, Denmark, New Zealand, Russia and the United Kingdom. It has since
                        been certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and was
                        named by several publications as one of the best albums of the 2010s, including Rolling Stone,
                        who later included it at 269 on its 2020 list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

                        The Life of Pablo is the seventh studio album by American rapper and producer Kanye West. It was
                        released on February 14, 2016, through GOOD Music and distributed by Def Jam Recordings.
                        Recording sessions took place from 2013 to 2016, in Italy, Mexico, Canada, and the United
                        States. West and a variety of producers, including co-executive producers Rick Rubin and Noah
                        Goldstein handled production. West enlisted guest vocals for the album from Chance the Rapper,
                        Kid Cudi, Desiigner, Rihanna, The Weeknd, Ty Dolla Sign, Post Malone, Kendrick Lamar, Sia, Vic
                        Mensa, Chris Brown, Young Thug, and Sampha.

                        Several promotional singles preceded the release of The Life of Pablo, including the tracks
                        "Real Friends" and "No More Parties in LA". During the months before its release, the album's
                        title and tracklist went through several publicized changes. West premiered an early version at
                        Madison Square Garden on February 11, 2016, as part of his Yeezy Season 3 fashion show. After
                        several additional sessions and alterations, the exclusive launch occurred for streaming on
                        Tidal three days later.

                        Following its official streaming debut, West continued to make changes to The Life of Pablo. A
                        largely updated version of it, including alternate mixes and other changes, was made available
                        on other streaming services and for digital purchase on his website on April 1, 2016. The
                        singles "Famous", the two-part "Father Stretch My Hands", and "Fade" were released to support it
                        in 2016. The album received generally positive reviews from music critics, with particular
                        attention being paid to the fragmented, unfinished nature of the composition and release.
                        Multiple publications named it one of 2016's best albums.

                        The Life of Pablo received five nominations at the 2017 Grammy Awards, including Best Rap Album,
                        though the Album of the Year rejection was deemed a snub by numerous publications. Following
                        Tidal's initial disclosure of its streaming data and its release to competing streaming
                        services, the album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, becoming the first to reach
                        the summit primarily through streaming, and was ultimately certified double platinum by the
                        Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It also debuted at number one in Norway, and
                        in the top ten in Canada, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Sweden.

                        Ye is the eighth studio album by American rapper Kanye
                        West. It was released on June 1, 2018, through GOOD Music and distributed by Def Jam Recordings.
                        Following controversy surrounding an interview with TMZ, West re-recorded all the work on the
                        album, with him completing it over the course of just two weeks at West Lake Ranch in Jackson
                        Hole, Wyoming. Guest vocals from PartyNextDoor, Ty Dolla Sign, Kid Cudi, Charlie Wilson,
                        Jeremih, and 070 Shake, among others, are included.

                        West produced Ye with Mike Dean, alongside numerous others. Succeeding the release of Pusha T's
                        Daytona, the album was the second of five seven-track albums produced by West in what were
                        referred to as the "Wyoming Sessions", which were set to be released weekly. It preceded the
                        release of West's collaborative album with Kid Cudi, as Kids See Ghosts, titled Kids See Ghosts.
                        The latter's release was succeeded by that of Nas' Nasir, and Teyana Taylor's K.T.S.E.. West
                        held a listening party for Ye on May 31, 2018, which was livestreamed from Jackson Hole.

                        "Yikes" and "All Mine" were released as singles in the summer of 2018 in support of Ye, with a
                        lyric video being released for the latter simultaneously with one for non-single "Violent
                        Crimes". Both of the singles attained top 20 positions on the US Billboard Hot 100, while the
                        album received generally favorable reviews from music critics. The majority of them drew
                        comparisons between the latter and West's previous works, while other critics had somewhat mixed
                        feelings towards the lyrical content. It was named as one of the best albums of 2018 by multiple
                        publications, including NME and Pitchfork.

                        Ye gave West his eighth consecutive album to debut at number one on the US Billboard 200, tying
                        him with Eminem's record. It was also a chart topper in Australia, Canada, Estonia, Ireland, and
                        New Zealand, becoming West's second number one album in the first of the five territories. Top
                        five positions were further attained in the Czech Republic, Denmark, Iceland, the Netherlands,
                        Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. The album has been certified platinum and gold in the
                        United States and the UK by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and British
                        Phonographic Industry (BPI), respectively.

                    My life is His, I'm no longer my own"

                        Jesus Is King is the ninth studio album by American rapper Kanye West. It was released on
                        October 25, 2019, through GOOD Music and distributed by Def Jam Recordings. The album follows a
                        Christian theme, different from his usual work. West described it as "an expression of the
                        gospel". It features guest appearances from Clipse, Ty Dolla Sign, Kenny G, Fred Hammond, Ant
                        Clemons, and the Sunday Service Choir. Production is included from West, Federico Vindver, Angel
                        Lopez, BoogzDaBeast, and Timbaland, among others.

                        West began recording the album in August 2018, originally announcing it as Yandhi. The album
                        missed two initial release dates in September and November 2018 under the original title, before
                        being delayed indefinitely due to leaks. West had formed his gospel group the Sunday Service
                        Choir in January 2019, performing gospel songs and covers of songs from West's discography. The
                        song "Water" was performed live prior to release by the group. In August 2019, Yandhi was
                        reannounced as Jesus Is King, but it missed two planned release dates for late September 2019
                        under the new title.

                        The final release of Jesus Is King was simultaneous with that of a concert film of the same
                        name, which included a number of the tracks as part of the soundtrack. The singles "Follow God"
                        and "Closed on Sunday" were both released in November 2019, charting in the top 20 of the US
                        Billboard Hot 100. The album received mixed reviews from music critics, with a number of them
                        drawing comparisons between it and West's previous solo album, Ye (2018). Some critics
                        complimented the former's composition, while others expressed negative feelings towards the
                        lyrics and the inconsistency of ideas.

                        Jesus Is King won the Top Christian Album and Top Gospel Album awards at the 2020 Billboard
                        Music Awards and Best Contemporary Christian Music Album at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards in
                        2021. It stood as West's record-tying ninth consecutive album to debut atop the US Billboard
                        200. In addition, West broke several Billboard charts' records. The album was a chart topper in
                        nine other countries, including Australia and Canada, while attaining top five positions in the
                        Czech Republic, Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. It has been
                        certified gold and silver in the United States and the UK by the Recording Industry Association
                        of America (RIAA) and British Phonographic Industry (BPI), respectively. A companion album,
                        Jesus Is Born, was released in December 2019 by the Sunday Service Choir.

                        Donda is the tenth studio album by American rapper Kanye West. It was released through GOOD
                        Music on August 29, 2021, and distributed by Def Jam Recordings. West recorded much of the
                        material at multiple locations in the summer of 2021, including Bighorn Mountain Ranch in
                        Wyoming and Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. It features guest vocals from the Sunday Service
                        Choir, Jay-Z, Playboi Carti, Lil Baby, The Weeknd, Vory, DaBaby, and Marilyn Manson; vocals from
                        Chris Brown were also included prior to the album being updated. West, BoogzDaBeast, Dem Jointz,
                        Mike Dean, and Ojivolta primarily helmed its production.

                        The album was initially set for release in July 2020 under the title of God's Country, but
                        experienced multiple delays. Its first public listening event was held at Mercedes-Benz Stadium
                        on July 22, 2021, followed by a second event there on August 5 that set a record for the biggest
                        Apple Music livestream. The third and final listening event was conducted at Soldier Field in
                        Chicago on August 26, 2021. The album is primarily a hip hop, gospel, progressive rap, and pop
                        record that features elements of numerous other genres, including trap and drill. It is both
                        minimalist and maximalist, with darker lyrical content and the reduced use of drums in
                        comparison to West's prior efforts. Themes explored include religion, Kanye's divorce from Kim
                        Kardashian, and Donda West, whose forename is used for the title.

                        Upon its release, Kanye West accused Universal Music Group of having released Donda without his
                        approval, which the label denied. "Hurricane" was released as the lead single in September 2021,
                        and was followed by both "Believe What I Say" and "Off the Grid" in November. The album received
                        mixed reviews from music critics, who were mostly divided towards its cohesiveness. Some noted
                        an improvement from West's previous work and praised the composition, though numerous reviewers
                        criticized the long runtime. Donda is a nominee for both Album of the Year and Best Rap Album at
                        the 64th Annual Grammy Awards, while "Jail" and "Hurricane" have been nominated for Best Rap
                        Song and Best Melodic Rap Performance, respectively.

                        Donda initially scored the most first-day streams for an album in 2021 on both Apple Music and
                        Spotify. It stood as West's 10th consecutive chart-topper on the US Billboard 200, tying the
                        record set by Eminem. It reached the summit in 18 other regions, including Australia, France,
                        and the United Kingdom, becoming West's first number-one album in the second country. The album
                        has been certified gold in the United States by the Recording Industry Association of America
                        (RIAA), alongside being awarded the certification and a platinum one in New Zealand and Canada
                        by Recorded Music NZ (RMNZ) and Music Canada (MC), respectively. As a result of their separate
                        allegations of homophobia and sexual abuse, the appearances from DaBaby and Marilyn Manson
                        created controversy amongst audiences. In October 2021, the Donda Stem Player was issued,
                        allowing users to remix the songs and adding new ones, while a deluxe edition was released on
                        November 14.
